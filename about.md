Today is 1st of April 2018 and I'm officiallly staring my journey to become Ruby on Rails developer. Doing it **1 crappy line a day** way (as in [The "Do something" principle][https://markmanson.net/do-something]) - that's the best way for me to stay consistent and like the process. In reality my minimum requirement for the day is 15 minutes of work with [The Odin Project][https://www.theodinproject.com/] and at least 1 line of code written/edited (when I'll be ready to write something). Hopefully [The Odin Project][https://www.theodinproject.com/] will take care of the second requirement most of the time. [The Odin Project][https://www.theodinproject.com/] will be my curriculum for this journey sometimes supplemented with other resources. I plan to work as Junior Ruby on Rails Developer in less than two years thinking it's rather pessimistic assumption. No matter how long may it take, the most important thing is to get there and enjoy the process. Wish me luck.
