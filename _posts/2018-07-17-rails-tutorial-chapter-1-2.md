title: Hartl's Rails Tutorial - Chapter 1 & 2
---
Today I read first two chapters of Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/). Only read cause I went through them before. I executed first chapter somewhere in the beginning of my learning - it was very simple app displaying "Hello World!". Second chapter was also extremely simple app - Photogram that I wrote few days ago was a lot more advanced.
