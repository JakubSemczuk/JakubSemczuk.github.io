title: Day 20 - Installations
---
I planned to change my Linux distro for quite some time and I finally did it. Before I was using Mint XFCE and now I'm happy user of beautiful [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/). Today I finally got to installing all the stuff needed for development: Ruby, Rails, Git, Heroku, Atom, RVM.
There is one caveat with eOS though. I don't really understand it yet, but it seems I will need to start every programming session with 'bash -l' command to "run as a login shell", or switch from bash to zsh, which seems to be popular among rubists. It doesn't matter for now, but is something to keep in mind.
