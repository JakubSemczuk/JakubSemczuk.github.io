title: Day 3 - Command line practice
---
Today I've finished [Command line basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/command-line-basics) section from The Odin Project. I really like how Odin curricullum is structured - it's really enjoyable with practice and repetition included. I went through one optional thing which was two sections of practice from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) which I also enjoyed. Good day :)
