title: Tutorial about building a RESTful API
---
I read [this tutorial](https://www.airpair.com/ruby-on-rails/posts/building-a-restful-api-in-a-rails-application) about building a RESTful API. for context gathering I watched [this talk](https://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-docker-isn-t-just-for-deployment) about Docker and [this talk](https://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-processes-and-threads-resque-vs-sidekiq) about Processes vs Threads.
