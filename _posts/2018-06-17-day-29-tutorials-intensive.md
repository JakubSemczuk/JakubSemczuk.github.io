title: Day 29 - Intensive day of reading and watching tutorials.
---
Today I went through quite a lot. My pomodoro timer says 3 hours and 45 minutes of pure focused learning. Slept like a log between learning sessions.
Firstly I watched [this Rails overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTBCHu0btn8). This lady was explaining Ruby on Rails to people learning programming in some other language (Harvard CS50) by showing how to build simple todo app - great explanation. Then I read [this tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/zero-to-sixty-creating-and-deploying-a-rails-app-in-under-an-hour--net-8252) on creating simple bookshelf application also directed at Rails novices. Then [talk about Ruby in Github](https://confreaks.tv/videos/mwrc2013-ruby-at-github) and [Sandi Metz video about some OO programming concepts](https://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-nothing-is-something) that'll probably prove very useful in the future but I will need to watch this talk again when I'll already little bit seasoned in writing code. It was very interesting though and not that hard to understand loosely.
