title: Day 24 - Simple book review app built from scratch (video)
---
On day 24 I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMai9EZesXY) where a guy is building simple book review app from scratch. It's part 1 of 4 but the most important things are there.
I also listened to motivational [talk from Dain Miller about sophistication](https://soundcloud.com/starthere-webdev/the-sophistication-rant/s-z0xDP).
