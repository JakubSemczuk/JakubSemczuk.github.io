title: Day 30 - Hartl chapter 2 and conference talks
---
Another intensive day. My pomodoro timer shows 3 hours and 30 minutes of pure focused learning today.
Firstly I watched [this lecture from the RailsConf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aApmOZwdPqA) which I found completely useless for learning about coding - maybe got something about programmers job, but not too much I guess. Then I watched [this talk about refactoring from Aloha Ruby Conf 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-pQPq0acs) which cemented some important information about refactoring like null code pattern from talk I watched yesterday and about importance of attempting to write short methods etc. Then I went through [Chapter 2 of Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app) about creating simple Twitter like app with scaffolding. It made many things clear to me. I didn't write the code, just read the whole chapter trying to understand it thoroughly. But now I think I could write this app without looking at the book (just having Google at hand).
It was productive day and I really think I understand more about Rails than I did yesterday.
