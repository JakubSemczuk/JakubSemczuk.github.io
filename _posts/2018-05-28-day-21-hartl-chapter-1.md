title: Day 21 - Hartl's Rails Tutorial Chapter 1
---
I had a break from learning, but made few important decisions through this time. I decided to change my learning curriculum. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is absolutely great, but it's systematic, university like, from the ground up and I think that in my situation it's not the fastest way get hired. I need to "hack" my way to be employable as soon as possible. It seems to me that the best way to get there is getting to the point of being able to write simple web app in Rails by myself. I don't need more HTML or CSS skills for that - my current skills are enough. I need Rails skills. I bought [The Advanced Begginer Challenge course](https://starthereacademy.teachable.com/p/abc-course) and will loosely follow it.

Interesting thing is that it starts with reading Chapter 1 of [Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/). The book that is also main content of [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and that was recommended to me when I decided to go with Rails. [The Advanced Begginer Challenge course](https://starthereacademy.teachable.com/p/abc-course) recommends to only read it at first but I actually did all the exercises.
