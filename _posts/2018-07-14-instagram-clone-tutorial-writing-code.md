title: Instagram clone tutorial - Day 1
---
Today I went through half of [this tutorial](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-test-driven-with-ruby-on-rails-part-1/) (half of part 1). I didn't look at the code in the tutorial before writing it myself first. The only exception were visual parts of haml bootstrap templates that I rewrote and scss that I copied. As I couldn't have guessed it and they are not the things I want to focus on now.
Tutorial is little bit outdated and I decided to make some changes to make it little more challenging. Used ActiveStorage instead of Paperclip gem for images and ~~form_for~~ form_with helper instead of simple_form gem. I got to know about them when going through the tutorial - Paperclip wrote on their README that it's deprecated (and that they recommend using ActiveStorage now) and I found about form_with when I was checking how to add classes to form_for.
I also quickly went through 2 haml tutorials: [1](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/haml/) and [2](http://haml.info/tutorial.html).
