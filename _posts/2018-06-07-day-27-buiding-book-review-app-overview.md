title: Day 27 - Building book review app overview
---
On day 27 I read 3 part tutorial on how to build simple book review app ([http://lugolabs.com/articles/75-building-a-ruby-on-rails-app-part-1-the-app](1), [http://lugolabs.com/articles/76-building-a-ruby-on-rails-app-part-2-styling-the-layout](2), [https://www.lugolabs.com/articles/building-a-ruby-on-rails-app-part-3-importing-book-details-from-amazon](3)). Didn't understand everything yet unfortunately :(
