title: Playing with blog with Google OAuth
---
Today I was playing with [blog with Google OAuth app](https://github.com/KubaSemczuk/blog-with-Google-oauth) I created on 28.07.18. I made views nicer, rewrote them from erb to [slim](http://slim-lang.com/) (which I love now), made few other small changes and deployed it to [heroku](https://simple-blog-with-google-oauth.herokuapp.com/).
