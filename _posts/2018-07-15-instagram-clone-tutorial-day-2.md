title: Instagram clone tutorial - Day 2
---
Today I went throuth the rest of [this tutorial](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-test-driven-with-ruby-on-rails-part-1/) (half of part 1). Writing the code myself before checking it in the tutorial and doing it little bit differently
Won't be going through the second part of this tutorial as I've decided to go through Haartl's Tutorial from start to finish now.
