title: CodeCademy Learn CSS interactive tutorial
---
I wanted to refresh my CSS knowledge so I went through CodeCademy Learn CSS tutorial. It was extremely verbose, took quite a few hours but I actually learned stuff I didn't know at all and had good reminder on what I already knew. Next one will be SASS.
