title: Day 23 - MVC architecture, Progress by DHH
---
On day 23 I watched [short video about MVC architecture from Lynda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mQjtk2YDkM), [DHH talk about not comfortable progress in Rails and in life from Rails Conf 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOFTop3AMZ8), listened to [talk from Dain Miller about this way of learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GauSQK6kHXc) and read [short tut about installing Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04).
