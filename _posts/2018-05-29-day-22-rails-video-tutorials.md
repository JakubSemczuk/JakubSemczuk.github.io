title: Day 22 - Rails video tutorials
---
I watched two Rails video tutorials ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86P3hX05QXI), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAQ6vge319A)). For next few days I'll be reading and watching more tutorials to gather context. Context gathering is the idea advocated by Dain Miller from [The Advanced Beginner Challenge](https://starthereacademy.teachable.com/p/abc-course) to immerse oneself deep in the materials around chosen technology without following through tutorials and even sometimes without understanding them 100%. That way our pattern matching mind connects the dots and we are getting a lot better equipped for the following through part of learning and where we'll be progressing faster.
