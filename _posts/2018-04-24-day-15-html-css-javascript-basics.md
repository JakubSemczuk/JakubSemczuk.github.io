title: Day 15 - Introduction to the Front End
---
Today was a reading day. Reading about what front-end development is, what are HTML, CSS, JS and the very basics of them. I also started reading HTML documentation on Mozilla Developer Network.

I'm familiar with basic HTML and CSS. Was "hacking" my way into them when needed. Now is the time to learn them properly and be able to use them easily.
