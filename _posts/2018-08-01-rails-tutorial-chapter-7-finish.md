title: Rails Tutorial Chapter 7 finished
---
Today I finished Chapter 7 of Hartl's Rails Tutorial. User can register now (without using Devise or any other authentication gem). I think I'll make few days break from this tutorial to do few basic tutorials on CodeCademy and rewrite views to slim to have more fun later as slim is more pleasant to work with than erb.
