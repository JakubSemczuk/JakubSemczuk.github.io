title: Instagram clone tutorial
---
I carefully read [this tutorial](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/) about building a simple Instagram clone with Rails. I'll be going through this tutorial again soon writing the code this time. For context gathering I also watched [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBfVxBj61z0) from Basecamp founders (DHH and Jason Fried) and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMFs9DTympQ) from Aaron Patterson.
