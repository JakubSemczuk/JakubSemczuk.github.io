title: Get back to learning
---
I had quite a long break from learning after [Netguru Code College](https://kubasemczuk.github.io/netguru-code-college/). Now is time to get back to learning. Today, to remind myself what I was doing lastly, I reread Chapter 8 from [Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). Tomorrow getting back to coding :)
