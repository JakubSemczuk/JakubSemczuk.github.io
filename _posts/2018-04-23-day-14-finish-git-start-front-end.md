title: Git section finished, front-end section started
---
Today I made some fixes on this blog, finished little [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/practicing-git-basics)'s project on creating a repo on Github and playing with Git workflow with commands and started new section about Front End. As recommended in Mozilla guides I'll use lowercase in filenames from now on.
