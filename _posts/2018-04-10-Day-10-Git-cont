title: Day 10 - Git continued, reflections and important conversation
---
Yesterday and the day before I didn't write posts. Didn't see a point as they would contain one sentence, would be basically saying the same things and would be repetitions of what happened on day 7. Also my posts are usually just small updates. And because of that I'm considering moving this blog to twitter. It's not important for now and I didn't made my decision yet, just considering it.
So what was I doing? I was still learning about git and GitHub. It was tedious, I even reread one thing three times, read optional stuff, but I finally feel I understand basics of how it works quite well. Next lesson will be playing with it in the command line.
I also called my friend who works as RoR developer for 5 or so years. He actually was my inspiration to do it and to go with rails specifically. I asked him many, many questions about his work, about junior developers he sees there, about how he started and how I should do it. We ended up talking for almost hour and a half.
