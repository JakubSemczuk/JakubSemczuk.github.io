title: Git command line Codeacademy interactive lesson
---
Today I finished interactive lesson on using Git with command line on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow). Tomorrow will have similar lesson on Codeschool it seems. In few days I should start updating this blog with command line. Probably could have started doing it today but it would take considerably more time.
