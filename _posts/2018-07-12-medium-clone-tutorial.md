title: Medium clone video tutorial
---
Today I watched [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoUInciCQ806CUFxld2W29V6rbGNfHzbX ) walking through building Medium clone in Rails and [this video](https://gorails.com/episodes/rails-application-structure?autoplay=1) walking through files and folders of Rails app. Tomorrow I'll start applying the tutorials and writing the code.
