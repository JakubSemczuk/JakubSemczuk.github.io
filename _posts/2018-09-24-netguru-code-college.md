title: Netguru Code College

Between 20th and 31th of August 2018 I was in [Netguru](https://www.netguru.co/)'s headquarters in Pozna≈Ñ attending their RoR workshops named Netguru Code College. It were 2 amazing weeks where I learned a lot. First few days we were listening to some lectures - mostly on Ruby and RoR. Then we were divided into groups and, through most of the workshops, were developing simple web app that we chose from ideas submitted by group members. My group developped and app to split the bills. Very simple [splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) equivalent (none of us knew about splitwise before). At the end app wasn't working exactly as planned. Some features were written in last minutes in very ugly way, but we learned really a lot during this process. Great people and amazing experience.
