title: Day 7 - Git and not enough disk space
---
Today I countinued lesson about Git, moved further but not too much (1.6 of [git-scm.com]). Went into problem with making changes to Git config file from terminal. It turned out to be not enough space on the disk, but it took me about half an hour to find it out :D But I understand Git a bit better today.
