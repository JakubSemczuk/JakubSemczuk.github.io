title: Day 2 - getting familiar with command line.
---

Yesterday I've setup this blog with help from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and wrote short [About](https://jakubsemczuk.github.io/about/) page. It was my first exposure to GitHub and Jekyll. Guess it will give me some familiarity with GitHub and Ruby which might help me slightly along the way :) It still looks crappy but I won't deal with it now.

Today I started learning about Command line and basically went through [this](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/command-line-basics). Fiddled with it a little bit and writing my first blog post about it now :) Already had to familiarize myself with some markdown and Jekyll file structure to do it.
