title: CodeCademy Sass interactive tutorial
---
Today I went through Sass tutorial on Codecademy and am glad I did. I know a lot lot more about Sass that I did. Going through such a tutorial takes a long time but is so much more pleasurable than reading docs. I love that with CodeCademy you learn by doing.
