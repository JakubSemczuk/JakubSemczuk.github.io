I started [my blog](https://kubasemczuk.github.io/) to document my learning to become RoR developer and keep myself accountable. It's hosted here on Github Pages to get me used to using Git. I used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to get started quicky. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) itself is written in Ruby - it'll also probably help me along the way.
